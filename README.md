##Summary##

The object of the shogiAI project is to design a front-end for a text-based interface, game engine and AI for the chess-like, Shogi. [Shogi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi) is a Japanese chess variant, based on the Chinese [xiangqi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi). It is played on a 9x9 board, and has a much larger game complexity tree than chess. For the most part, computers have yet to beat the best players in the game. The idea here is to construct several AIs at different levels, so professional and amateur players can take a crack against the computer.

##Status##

Currently, the text-based interface and game engine are under construction, and are stable and running. This component of the project is stored in the [/src/interface](https://github.com/richiebful/shogi/tree/master/src/interface) and [/src/engine](https://github.com/richiebful/shogi/tree/master/src/engine) folders respectively. As time lapses, we plan to add history functionality to the interface. Following some feature additions, GUI and AI will be constructed and added to the project.
