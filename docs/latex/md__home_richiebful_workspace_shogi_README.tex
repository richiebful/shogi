The object of the shogi\-A\-I project is to design a front-\/end for a text-\/based interface, game engine and A\-I for the chess-\/like, Shogi. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi}{\tt Shogi} is a Japanese chess variant, based on the Chinese \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi}{\tt xiangqi}. It is played on a 9x9 board, and has a much larger game complexity tree than chess. For the most part, computers have yet to beat the best players in the game. The idea here is to construct several A\-Is at different levels, so professional and amateur players can take a crack against the computer.

\subsection*{Status}

Currently, the text-\/based interface and game engine are under construction, and are nearing 75\% completion. This component of the project is stored in the \href{https://github.com/richiebful/shogi/tree/master/src/interface}{\tt /src/interface} and \href{https://github.com/richiebful/shogi/tree/master/src/engine}{\tt /src/engine} folders respectively. Any unit-\/testing files are currently in place to make testing go smoothly.
